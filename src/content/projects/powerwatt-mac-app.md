## Overview

**PowerWatt** is a lightweight macOS menu bar app to monitor your Mac’s real power draw.

It focuses on a calm UI (menu bar first) while still providing a deeper “Usage” window with system watts over time and per-app attribution.

## What it does

- **Real-time watts**: shows net watts or separate **IN/OUT** readings (charging vs discharging).
- **Per-app energy tracking**: Activity Monitor-style attribution to understand which apps are driving consumption.
- **Smoothing + refresh controls**: tame noisy spikes and tune update frequency.
- **Watts or Relative mode (auto)**: when macOS can’t expose total watts reliably (often while charging), it falls back to a relative score so rankings/charts remain useful.
- **Privacy-first**: telemetry is optional and off by default.
