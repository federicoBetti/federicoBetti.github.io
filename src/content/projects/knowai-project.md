## Overview

In collaboration with the SEI Pioneer project of the Fondazione Agnelli, I helped establish a proto-startup focused on applying Natural Language Processing to business communications. Knowai was designed to extract valuable insights from internal company conversations using advanced NLP techniques.

## Role and Contributions

As the technical lead for NLP development, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing text processing pipelines
- Developing knowledge extraction algorithms
- Creating visualization systems for extracted insights
- Integrating NLP models with web-based interfaces
- Presenting technical capabilities to potential investors

## Technology Stack

The solution leveraged:
- Advanced NLP models for text understanding
- Text mining techniques for pattern recognition
- Web development frameworks for user interfaces
- Database systems for knowledge storage and retrieval

## Outcomes

The project successfully demonstrated the value of applying NLP to business communications, attracting interest from investors and companies looking to better understand their internal knowledge flows. This experience provided valuable insights into both the technical challenges of applied NLP and the business considerations of launching a technology startup.
