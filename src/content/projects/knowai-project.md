## Overview

In collaboration with the SEI Pioneer project of the Fondazione Agnelli, I contributed to an applied NLP initiative focused on business communications. Knowai was designed to extract actionable insights from internal company conversations using modern NLP techniques.

## Role and Contributions

As the technical lead for NLP development, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing text processing pipelines
- Developing knowledge extraction algorithms
- Creating visualization systems for extracted insights
- Integrating NLP models with web-based interfaces
- Presenting technical capabilities to stakeholders

## Technology Stack

The solution leveraged:
- Advanced NLP models for text understanding
- Text mining techniques for pattern recognition
- Web development frameworks for user interfaces
- Database systems for knowledge storage and retrieval

## Outcomes

The project demonstrated the value of applying NLP to business communications, attracting interest from organizations looking to better understand internal knowledge flows. This experience strengthened my ability to deliver applied NLP systems that translate research ideas into stakeholder-ready outcomes.
