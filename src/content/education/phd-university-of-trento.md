## Research Focus

My doctoral research at the University of Trento focuses on advancing multimodal AI systems, particularly in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing. Under the guidance of Professor Nicu Sebe, I am exploring innovative approaches to image generation, evaluation, and optimization.

## Key Research Areas

- **Image Generation Evaluation**: Developing ViCE (Visual Concept Evaluation), a novel framework that mimics human cognitive behavior to assess consistency between generated images and their corresponding prompts. This work combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) in a unified pipeline.

- **Diffusion Models Optimization**: Creating methodologies to optimize resource consumption in diffusion models through early hallucination detection (HEaD). My research focuses on computational efficiency for complex generative tasks, reducing generation time while maintaining output quality.

- **Multimodal AI Systems**: Investigating the integration of visual and textual information in AI systems to enhance performance and create more human-like evaluation metrics for generative models.

## Publications

My PhD research has already contributed to multiple publications in prestigious conferences, including papers at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia and the European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, exploring topics in generative AI and evaluation methodologies.
